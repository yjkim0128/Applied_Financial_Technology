# Applied_Financial_Technology

This repository includes a Python-based stock trading algorithm (pairs trading strategy for US equity) I wrote for MPCS 52560: Applied Financial Technology at The University of Chicago Master's Program in Computer Science (MPCS).  

This code is supposed to be executed on QuantConnect platform. (www.quantconnect.com)  
This algorithm consistently outperformed S&P 500 for most of time periods when backtested.  

Acknowledgement: this code is co-written with Ronald Kwan, also from the University of Chicago MPCS.
